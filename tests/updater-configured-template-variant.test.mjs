/**
 * updater-configured-template-variant.test.mjs — a user-authored named CV/
 * cover-letter template variant, created per cv-templates.mjs's own naming
 * convention (`templates/cv-template.{name}.html`, `templates/cover-letter-
 * template.{name}.html` — see its KINDS/parseFilename) and pointed at from
 * config/profile.yml (`cv.template` / `cover_letter.template`), must survive
 * the stale-file prune in `apply()` even though it never exists upstream.
 *
 * Distinct from #3636 / PR #3638 (generated PER-APPLICATION output such as
 * `templates/cv-jane-doe-acme-corp.html`): this covers a genuinely authored
 * template VARIANT, whose filename is, by design, indistinguishable from a
 * real shipped variant (`cv-template.zh-minimal.html`) on shape alone. The
 * only signal that separates "my personal variant" from "a shipped variant
 * upstream has since removed, prune it" is whether config/profile.yml itself
 * names this variant as the active default — exactly what cv-templates.mjs's
 * resolveTemplate() already relies on to pick it for CV generation.
 *
 * Also pins the two-cycle failure mode that makes this a genuinely distinct
 * bug from what #2337's generic locally-modified-file protection already
 * covers: on the FIRST apply() after the file is created, it differs from
 * both the pre-update baseline and upstream, so locallyModifiedSystemFiles()
 * flags it as "at risk" and apply() preserves it (with a .bak) via
 * preservedPaths. But that protection is baseline-relative — the very next
 * "chore: auto-update system files" commit re-baselines to a tree that
 * already contains the (untouched) variant file, so on every SUBSEQUENT
 * apply() run it no longer differs from baseline, drops out of
 * locallyModifiedSystemFiles()'s result, and — being permanently absent
 * upstream — falls straight into the stale-file prune with nothing left to
 * protect it. staleSystemFiles() must therefore carry its own, baseline-
 * independent exemption instead of relying on the preservedPaths detour.
